# Position Papers

The Chairs are using your position papers as the basis for selecting topics and content for discussion during the workshop. In addition, the position papers are reviewed by the Chairs to determine the final list of Program Committee members.

## Timeline for Submission and Review

The Chairs need your papers to be submitted by **Friday, June 9** (the upcoming Program Committee call). Reviews will be completed by **Monday, June 13**.

## Review Criteria

Be mindful of the following evaluation criteria in writing your papers:

#### Does the paper present a clear topic or set of topics?

Be careful to not present a scattershot of general points that only serve to establish a high-level point of view.

#### Does the paper demonstrate a high degree of technical aptitude?

The goal is to elevate topics that are backed with thoughtful, technical content. We want to avoid discussions about vaporware, far-future possibilities, or topics that are purely aspirational.

#### Does the paper cite and support claims it makes about positive or negative positions?

If your position paper takes a stance or makes a claim, positive or negative, please be sure to support that claim with sources or examples that clearly demonstrate its relevance, probability of occurrence, or foundation in empirical fact.
