# Standards Criteria

In the context of this workshop, the following general criteria are relevant to identify when something is suitable for standardization (which is a particular approach to the larger goal of interoperability):

## Standardization Value and Readiness 

1. __Problem Statement__: Is there a clear problem statement that this would solve, for a significant number of people?
2. __Starting Point__: Is there a good starting point, such as a clear solution, or a set of competing solutions?
3. __Stakeholder Commitment__: Do we have the right stakeholders ready to commit to the work, including implementers who would deploy the feature, and individuals willing to write, review, and test the specification?

## W3C Focus and Fit 

For standardization at W3C specifically, the focus is on the Web, in three main areas:

* **Client-side** (browser-based) features, like markup languages, JavaScript APIs, or user-facing features
  * this is W3C's main focus
* **Data and formats**, such as interchange formats, vocabularies/ontologies, and languages to manipulate data
  * _note that this area is usually treated with some skepticism by browser makers_
* **Communication protocols** 
  * W3C does this much more rarely, typically only when there's a corresponding client-side API, and usually in partnership with IETF

#  Starting Points

## Joe Roets - Disney Notes on Blockchain Standardization

1. __What features could DLT add to the Web Platform?__
  * Secure distribution of data, i.e. Moving data to the edge/web service (lower latency and downtime)
  * Lightweight verification of data quality or information assurance at the endpoint
  * Ability to independently verify local data (e.g. authN/Z, configuration) with controlled risk (enterprise + trusted partner + external blockchain [Hyperledger or Bitcoin])
  * Real-time enterprise governance capabilities (e.g. in transactional information, configuration items, key management activities)
  * Micro-payment web service request applications
  
2. __What would we need to add to the Web Platform to enable DLT?__
  * For distributed data use cases, locally available network node or blockchain data (likely operated parallel)
  * For micro-payment applications, use of web service request components (e.g. 21.co marketplace headers HTTP_BITCOIN_MICROPAYMENT_SERVER and HTTP_RETURN_WALLET_ADDRESS)
  * Access to respective blockchain library(s)
  
3. __Some aspects are nearing the point where standardization would be warranted â€“ such as:__
  * Proof/verification algorithms (e.g. PoW [SHA-256 v Scrypt v x11], PoS, proof of identity/trust, other proofs)
  * Abstraction of cryptographic libraries
  * Block verification structures
  * Consensus algorithm

IRT #3 above, it would be possible to create a foundation which defined pluggable component interfaces allowing the creation of custom blockchains with known best practice implementations to fit a given need. Most of these interfaces could theoretically be loosely defined today, and multiple implementations could readily be made available.
